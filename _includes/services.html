                    <p class="text-muted">Visit our Heritage Forest in Hickory, NC and learn about the history of the American Chestnut tree while walking among them. Visitors will also learn about other heritage trees that played an instrumental part of Appalachian history. Each visitor will be able to utilize an American Chestnut Learning Box that includes nuts, burs and leaves from American and Chinese chestnut trees, a chestnut “tree cookie” (tree ring slice), five different types of wood blocks, chestnut tree sections showing inoculation sites and chestnut blight, and a binder with explanatory fact sheets for each sample and learning materials.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">A special event to raise funds and awareness for The American Chestnut Foundation and the Heritage Educational Forest. Individuals and families will be able to purchase tickets to have an overnight camping experience suspended from tree branches in the Heritage Educational Forest. Special hammocks will be cabled to branches allowing campers a bird’s eye view of the natural habitat of the American Chestnut. For those wanting to stay on the ground tents will be erected around the communal fire pit. All participants will learn about The Eastern Forest Ecosystem from American Chestnut Foundation experts.

                    <p class="text-muted">We were fortunate to have an old farmstead at the Heritage Educational Forest. In the main farmhouse there are several rooms for indoor learning and research. There is also a room dedicated to the history of the American Chestnut in the Appalachian region since it was such an integral part of the society. These can also be rented out for special events.  You will also discover a gift shop with a variety of local crafts, books, movies, and American Chestnut memorabilia.</p>
